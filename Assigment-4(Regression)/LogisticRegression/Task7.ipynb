    "1. What are the assumptions of linear regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It also assumes homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors), independence of observations, no multicollinearity among predictors, and normally distributed residuals.\n",

    "Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is categorical, typically binary (e.g., 0 or 1, yes or no), whereas linear regression is used for predicting continuous outcomes."

    "\n",
    "The sigmoid function maps a single input to a value between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification. The softmax function, on the other hand, is used in multi-class classification and outputs a probability distribution over multiple classes that sums to 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "R-squared measures the proportion of variance explained in linear regression, which assumes continuous outcomes. Logistic regression deals with probabilities and categorical outcomes, so metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC are more appropriate.\n",
